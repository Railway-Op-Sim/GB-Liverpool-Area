Notes:

Lime st very busy, trains usually have arrival times that allow themn to be held outside fo a while when necessary

wigan/st helens jn mainly use plats 1 to 5, warrington & runcorn use 6 to 10 but not always

check lime st arrival times when 2 or more trains heading that way

eastwards normally use p1 & p3 at edge hill, westwards p2 & p4, but sometimes others to avoid delays so plan ahead

roby/huyton use p3 & 4 for eastwards, 4 only for wigan 


OK57 eastwards stops at Ditton east jn for at least 11 mins, position it diagonally at ditton jn & 1F44 crosses to bottom track then back up before LSP to plat 2 - describe better, needed to avoid delays, 1F92 waits at runcorn until 08:11 to allow 0K57 to get out of way.  After 1D01 has passed the signal before runc the route to runcorn and exit can be set for OK57.

use fast lines from lsp to runcorn wherever possible, hold trains from warr outside lsp for traffic from runcorn 
care needed at LSP, services use plats 1 & 2 except where noted in description '(LSP P4)' so hold warrington trains outside jn when trains from runcorn approaching & warr timetable shows arrival after runcorn trains
adhere to correct plats at lime st or will have trouble!

mainly x1 speed, x2 some of time esp when familiars, sometimes 0.5

5P15 needs to cross tracks to arrive in p3 so wait for 5P50 to clear the junction to allow it to cross, also 5F52 a bit later -> p5

Ensure that a train arriving in a platform that already has a train, or a train at a linked platform, that the train in the platform isn't scheduled to depart before the arriving train is sheduled to arrive, else will block it, also ensure that the arriving train departs before the existing train - this should always be the case 

often have call-on offers for wrong platforms, ignore

enough room for all freights in tubrook (check) at rhs though some can go to left is don't cause delays

reset diverging points after trains cross to prevent wrong routes being set later causing delays

routes for trains out from p1 - p5 should end at signal at 39-17 until know destination, in case need to cross tracks towards runcorn/warrington

routes for trains out from p6 - p10 should end at signal at 48-19 until know destination, in case need to cross tracks towards wigan/manchester

room for all freights in tubrook from both entries without needing to use sig control to move any
